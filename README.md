# THE-COMPLETE-DATA-SECURITY-SYSTEM
Now as we are aware of the problems faced by we as an end users while using conventional Login id and Password scheme knowingly or unknowingly, but the big question still arises in our mind is that if this conventional scheme has major disadvantages then why are we still using it?
The answer is that we as a human being try to resist change. Though we give you a much better scheme to login which is both User Friendly and Secured, then too people won’t prefer to use it or it can be said that its acceptance on large scale will take time.

	If the passwords are short, then they can be easily guessed. Also there 
           are chances that our password may get hacked.
           On the other hand if the password is too long, then they are hard to
 remember.     

	Someone standing behind or besides you can intentionally see the password while you are typing it (SHOULDER-SURFING).

	 If someone has installed KEYLOGGER software on your machine then your password gets revealed to others.
